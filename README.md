ZoOm SDK for Xamarin
------------
To get started with ZoOm, you must be registered.  If you don't have an app token, register for [developer access](https://dev.zoomlogin.com/).

Getting Started - Android
---------
To install the library for Android, simply open your project and install our NuGet package named `Xamarin.Zoom.AndroidLibrary`.  For more details on how to install a NuGet package, [see here](https://blog.xamarin.com/xamarin-studio-and-nuget/).

Once the library is installed, see our [Android Sample App](https://github.com/facetec/xamarin-zoom/tree/master/Samples/iOS) for an example of how to use it.  For a more in-depth explanation of the ZoOm SDK and its capabilities, see the [Android documentation](https://dev.zoomlogin.com/zoomsdk/#/android-guide) for the native library.

Getting Started - iOS
---------
To install the library for iOS, simply open your project and install our NuGet package named `Xamarin.Zoom.iOSLibrary`.  For more details on how to install a NuGet package, [see here](https://blog.xamarin.com/xamarin-studio-and-nuget/).

Once the library is installed, see our [iOS Sample App](https://github.com/facetec/xamarin-zoom/tree/master/Samples/iOS) for an example of how to use it.  For a more in-depth explanation of the ZoOm SDK and its capabilities, see the [iOS documentation](https://dev.zoomlogin.com/zoomsdk/#/ios-guide) for the native library.

Limitations
------
Most functionality of the native Android and iOS libraries is available through these libraries with some exceptions.  Most notably, there is currently no support for UI customization.  It will likely be added in the future.
